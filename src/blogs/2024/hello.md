Welcome guys!

Those who know me, know this is long coming (3+ years) I always talk about how I want a portfolio website and how I built a gazzillion versions of it. But for some reason or another, never completed any of them.

But! Here I am, finally committing to this one.

The purpose of this blog website is quiet a few actually,

- Since instagram is taken by beautiful people, LinkedIn by people getting promoted all the time and Twitter by people with really intimidating views about everything, I wanted a space of my own, where i can dump my views, my findings and experiences. I think of this blog site as my cottage up in the digital mountains. Not too much crowd, Not too much fuss.

- This blog site is far from perfect. I am missing curial features like search and commenting and what not. But thats the point. I've built this website from scratch (not literally, i used Sveltekit). I want to build features on this website piece by piece. (Feeds my sense of accomplishments)

- Meself is a lazy procrastinator. I lose interest very quickly when things get boring and i believe that's the reason for so many unfinished side projects. Another purpose of this blog site is to teach myself to enjoy the boring too.

I almost forgot to introduce myself. I am Yajat. I love software. I have been writing code half my life. Check out [the who page](www.yajatvishwakarma.com/whoami) to know more about me and [the now page](www.yajatvishwakarma.com/now) to see what i am currently doing.

That's about it I guess, I have nothing more to add to this blog. See you all soon!
