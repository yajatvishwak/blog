## Remember about the blog frontmatter

1. `year`, `title`, `blogID`(filename), `description` should be present
2. `title` is what will go in the tab menu
3. `heading` is what will show in the blog list and on the blog page as heading
4. `description` is what will be shown as a brief description in the blog listing page
