## Remember about the blog frontmatter

1. `date`, `title`, `blogID`(filename), `description` should be present
2. `title` is what will go in the tab menu
3. `description` is what will be shown as a brief description in the blog listing page

TODO:

1. Pagination on the main page
2. Search by topic and context
